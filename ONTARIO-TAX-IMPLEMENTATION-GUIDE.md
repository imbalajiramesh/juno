# ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Ontario Tax Implementation Guide for Juno

## ðŸ“‹ **Research Summary: Ontario Tax Requirements**

Based on current Canadian tax law research:

### **Ontario HST Structure:**
- **Total HST Rate**: 13%
- **Federal GST**: 5% 
- **Provincial portion**: 8%
- **Combined as HST**: Harmonized Sales Tax (single tax, not separate)

### **Digital Services Tax Requirements:**
- **Registration Threshold**: CAD $30,000 in B2C sales over 12 months
- **B2B Sales**: Reverse charge mechanism (no tax collection required)
- **B2C Sales**: Must collect 13% HST
- **Your Business**: Ontario-registered, so you collect HST on all Canadian sales

### **Key Facts:**
- SaaS/digital services are fully taxable in Canada
- Ontario uses HST (harmonized), not separate GST + PST
- Foreign businesses must register if exceeding CAD $30,000
- Since you're Ontario-based, you collect HST on all sales

## ðŸŽ¯ **Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Hardcode Ontario HST (13%)**
- Implement immediate tax collection for all customers
- Use fixed 13% rate for all transactions
- Simple, compliant, no Stripe Tax fees

### **Phase 2: Geographic Tax Logic (Future)**
- Expand to other Canadian provinces as needed
- Add international tax handling later
- Scale based on customer locations

## ðŸ’» **Technical Implementation**

Let's implement manual tax calculation with Ontario HST:

### **Step 1: Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Add to your .env
MANUAL_TAX_ENABLED=true
ONTARIO_HST_RATE=0.13
TAX_REGISTRATION_NUMBER=your_hst_number_here
BUSINESS_ADDRESS="Ontario, Canada"
```

### **Step 2: Tax Calculation Logic**
We'll create a tax calculation service that applies Ontario HST to all purchases.

### **Step 3: Update Payment Flow**
Modify checkout to show tax breakdown and collect appropriate amounts.

### **Step 4: Receipts & Compliance**
Ensure invoices show proper tax information for CRA compliance.

## ðŸ›  **Code Implementation**

Let me implement the manual tax system for your Juno application:

### **Tax Calculation Service**
A service to handle Ontario HST calculations with proper business logic.

### **Updated Checkout Flow**
Modified payment processing to include tax calculation and display.

### **Compliant Receipts**
Proper tax documentation for Canadian tax compliance.

### **Database Updates**
Store tax information for reporting and compliance.

## ðŸ“Š **Tax Breakdown Example**

**For a $9.99 Starter Package (USD pricing with HST):**
- **Subtotal**: $9.99 USD
- **HST (13%)**: $1.30 USD  
- **Total**: $11.29 USD

**Customer sees:**
```
Starter Package (500 credits)    $9.99 USD
HST (13%)                       $1.30 USD
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
