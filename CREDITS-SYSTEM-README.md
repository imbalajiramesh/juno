Safely updates credit balance with transaction logging:
- Prevents negative balances for deductions
- Logs all transactions automatically
- Returns success/failure status

## Environment Variables

```env
# Existing Vapi variables
VAPI_API_KEY=your_vapi_api_key
VAPI_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_default_phone_id

# New Twilio variables (required)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token

# App URL for webhooks
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Database Migration
Run the schema files in order:
```sql
-- Run these in sequence
\i credits-system-schema.sql
\i add-twilio-subaccount-to-tenants.sql
\i update-call-logs-for-twilio.sql
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Add Twilio credentials to your environment:
```bash
# .env.local
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
```

### 3. Initial Credits
Grant initial credits to existing tenants:
```sql
-- Example: Give 1000 credits to all existing tenants
INSERT INTO credit_balances (tenant_id, balance)
SELECT id, 1000 FROM tenants
ON CONFLICT (tenant_id) DO UPDATE SET balance = 1000;
```

## Credit Management

### Adding Credits
Users can add credits through the UI:
- Quick buttons for 500, 1000, 5000 credits
- Instant balance updates
- Transaction logging

### Automatic Deductions
Credits are automatically deducted:
- **Voice calls**: On call completion (minimum 1 minute)
- **Phone numbers**: On purchase (setup fee) and monthly billing
- **Failed calls**: Still charged minimum 1 minute

### Insufficient Balance Handling
- Voice agent creation: Not blocked (credits checked at call time)
- Phone number purchase: Blocked with clear error message
- Call attempts: Gracefully handled by Vapi

## Webhook Integration

The Vapi webhook automatically:
1. **Logs call start** with voice agent information
2. **Updates transcripts** in real-time during calls
3. **Calculates duration** and deducts credits on call end
4. **Handles billing** with minimum 1-minute charges

## Security & RLS

All tables implement Row Level Security:
- Tenants can only access their own data
- Service role has full access for system operations
- Credit functions use SECURITY DEFINER for safe operations

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- `VoiceAgent.costPerMinute` field removed
- Voice agent creation modal no longer accepts cost input
- Fixed pricing model replaces user-defined costs

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing voice agents continue to work
- Call logging enhanced but maintains compatibility
- No changes required to existing Vapi integrations

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Payment integration** for credit purchases
- **Monthly billing cycles** for phone numbers
- **Usage analytics** and reporting
- **Credit expiration** policies
- **Bulk phone number** management
- **International phone** number support

### API Extensibility
The credits system is designed to support:
- Multiple currency options
- Tiered pricing models

- Integration with payment processors

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Insufficient Credits Error**
   - Check current balance via API or UI
   - Add credits before attempting operations
   - Verify pricing configuration

2. **Phone Number Purchase Fails**
   - Verify Twilio credentials
   - Check area code availability
   - Ensure webhook URLs are accessible

3. **Credits Not Deducting**
   - Check webhook configuration
   - Verify Vapi call completion events
   - Review database function permissions

### Debug Commands

```sql
-- Check credit balance
SELECT * FROM credit_balances WHERE tenant_id = 'tenant_id';

-- View recent transactions
SELECT * FROM credit_transactions 
WHERE tenant_id = 'tenant_id' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check pricing config
SELECT * FROM pricing_config WHERE is_active = true;
```

## Support

For issues related to:
- **Credits system**: Check transaction logs and balance functions
